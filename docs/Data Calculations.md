While for most people simple capture start press play wait till end stop capture decode and that good enough you may need to get to exact points or samples or simply want to do proper doucmentation.


Dvide = /
Times = *  

For Ratio: Original / Compressed : 1

For Percentage: (Compressed / Original) * 100

For Ratio: Original Divided By Compressed ( to one )

For Percentage: Original Divided By Compressed Times 100

For Location scrubbing with multi-mode tapes, i.e SVHS and VHS mixed on the same tape


For RF Sample Scrubbing Time Calculations are Required

40 x 1000000 = MSPS Million Samples Per Second

400,000,000 x 10 Bits

4000000 x 30 = 720,000,000,000 = 30 Min

720,000,000,000 / 8 = 90,000,000,000 Bytes
