RF info:

Video RF tap points are pins #3 & 4 (signal & ground) located near the head drum
If signal is low, turning knobs to the right of tap points and returning to their original positions may improve output.

Capture/processing issues:

Captures from recordings that have HiFi audio result in bright video output with vhs-decode.
Captures from recordings with linear audio result in normal expected video levels, although luminance shifts appear to cause tbc disruptions. 
Various captures attached for reference with variable info in file names
