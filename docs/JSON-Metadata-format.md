title: JSON Metadata Format
---

The decode projects are made up of a series of decoders and tools which form a processing tool-chain for processing, analysing decoded RF samples.  In order for each tool in the chain to communicate in an efficient manner a JSON metadata file is used to store and communicate information about the decoded RF capture and any data that has been determined.  

Tools should (as appropriate) be able to accept metadata as well as output metadata.

This document describes the metadata format to be used by all tools in the decode tool-chain.


## Conventions


### Supported JSON data types

| **Name**    | **Qt Equivalent** | **Description**                |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| String      | QString           | String of UTF-8 characters     |
| Number      | qint32 or double  | Integer or real number         |
| JSON object | Object            | Object                         |
| Array       | Vector            | Vector of another type         |
| Boolean     | Qbool             | Boolean value of true or false |


###  File names


When producing a JSON metadata file the application/utility will use its normal file extension with `.json` added.  For example, ld-decode & cvbs-decode produces a `.tbc` file containing the composite signal, and a `.tbc.json` file containing the metadata. (For colour-under formats, vhs-decode additionally produces a file with the suffix `_chroma.tbc` containing the chroma signal; this can be processed using the same `.tbc.json` metadata.)

All metadata should be considered as optional.  Each tool will add metadata as appropriate but should be able to handle the case when metadata is not available.


### Invalid data fields


A field with a null or -1 value (for integers) should be considered as invalid.


### Object numbering

VBI frame numbers, sequential field numbers and field-lines are numbered starting from 1. A value of 0 should be considered as invalid.

### Notes:

A video system is a combination of a line standard and a colour standard - see [World TV Standards](http://web.archive.org/web/20190506044136/http://www.radios-tv.co.uk/Pembers/World-TV-Standards/index.html). `"PAL"` is standard 625-line PAL, and `"NTSC"` is standard 525-line NTSC; these are the only two systems used on LaserDisc. `"PAL-M"` is the 525-line PAL system used in Brazil, and is supported by vhs-decode. Other systems may be supported in the future.

The 'blackLevelStart' and 'blackLevelEnd' parameters point to a recommended section of the scan-line from which the average black level IRE can be determined.  This is typically from the end of the colour-burst (with some safety margin) to the beginning of the active video (again with some safety margin).

`fieldHeight` represents the taller of the two video fields. In the `.tbc` file, the shorter field will be padded with an additional line at the end to make both fields the same size. The first field is always the taller of the two - that is, in 625-line systems, the whole of line 313 is considered to be part of the first field, not the second (which is not always the convention used elsewhere).

`isSubcarrierLocked` indicates, for video sampling rates where there are not an integer number of samples in each line of video, whether the samples are aligned to the start of lines (line-locked) or to the colour subcarrier (subcarrier-locked). For subcarrier-locked sampling, any additional samples at the end of the frame can be found at the start of the second field's padding line. PAL digital video is often subcarrier-locked with a sample rate of 4fSC, giving four extra samples after the end of the second field; for NTSC, there are an integer number of 4fSC samples in a line so it doesn't make a difference.

### cc


This object represents Closed Caption data for a field.

| **Name** | **Type**         | **Description**                |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| ccData0  | Number (integer) | The first closed caption byte  |
| ccData1  | Number (integer) | The second closed caption byte |

For `ccData0` and `ccData1`, if the value is `-1` or not present then no valid CC was found. 0 is a valid value - it means that CC is present, but no data is being transferred on this line.

Note: See ANSI/CTA-608 for details.


### vitc


This object represents Vertical Interval Timecode data for a field.

| **Name** | **Type**      | **Description**           |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| vitcData | Integer Array | VITC raw data as 8 values |

Each of the values in `vitcData` represents 8 bits of the raw VITC data, without the framing bits or CRC. The LSB of `vitcData[0]` is VITC bit 2 (the LSB of the frame number), and the MSB of `vitcData[7]` is VITC bit 79.


### dropOuts
