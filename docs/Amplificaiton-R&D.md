This document has notes on amplifier development and a list of off-shelf amps in testing and available to buy and other misc notes.

This doc is mostly related to the improvement of the CX Cards SNR or signal-to-noise ratio. 


## Standardised Boards 



### Analogue Devices AD8367 


The most commonly deployed off-shelf RMS amplifier considered the go-to for HiFi/Video FM from tape and laserdisc formats, using 0603 parts it can be user modified if required.

### vhs-rf-amp-ada4857 


[ADA4857 GitLab Repo](https://gitlab.com/wolfre/vhs-rf-amp-ada4857)

Developed by Rene Wolf as a second generation, "adjust per unit" amplifier board based around the ADA4857 with 0805 pads for gain/input termination so requires an assortment resistor book and a entry to mid range benchtop type digital store oscilloscope.

The way the board is supplied, the 2 channels aren't configured the same.

Absolute gain range programmable
âˆ’14 dB to +34 dB (FBK shorted to OUT) through
0 dB to 48 dB (FBK open)

One channel has FBK shorted to OUT (-14 to +34) gain range, and the other channel has FBK open (0 to 48db) range, controlled by R5 and R6.
