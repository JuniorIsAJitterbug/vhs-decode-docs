# Commercial Usage


## Can I use vhs-decode commercially?


Yes.


## Are there licensing fees?


No, we do wish for appropriate credits in any production use if using this suit and its freely provided resources are employed.


Supporting the project is always encouraged. [Donations](Donations.md)


## Is the suite commercially viable for production usage?


Currently from an archival & preservation perspective.


Capture is fully viable as of 2023 with ''add-in'' integration into existing SDI & PCIe based workflows ideally on a separate workstation or server solution with RAID or SSD based ingest discs, and FLAC compression to cold storage.


Please See [Diagram Visuals](Diagram-Visuals.md) for full-scale breakdowns and workflows.


Decoding is an ever-evolving part of the project, while it beats all off-shelf solutions today, decoded data, however, should not be considered a final product as each year new improvements can make drastic differences, only the FM RF data can be considered final if a good capture is obtained.


## Is there support for commercial use?


The community and developers are across multiple time zones so support is available, alongside 3 years of searchable data that can be looked up inside the [DD86 Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/pVVrrxd).
