title: XDS Data
---

This is a signalling standard used by [PBS](https://www.pbs.org/) for analogue TV Transmissions

(This needs expanding on)

PBS had an encoding box built by Soft Touch for all PBS stations to encode the time-of-day, call letters, and "network" onto line 21 field 2 (EDS/XDS info)

## Extracting Data 


### Tools


FFmpeg & [QCTools](https://mediaarea.net/QCTools/Download)

[CC_Decoder](https://github.com/CordySmith/cc_decoder/tree/master/bin)


### Process 


As a very hacky and manual workaround, I managed to decode the PBS time by:

1. Loading the MKV into QCTools and enabling the EIA608 filter display.
2. Manually typing the relevant XDS Time bytes into a "fake" SCC file.
3. Converting the SCC file to human-readable "Closed Caption Disassembly" format using SCC Tools' CCASDI.

Input:

```
Scenarist_SCC V1.0

00:00:01:00    0701 D543 434C 4649 8FB3

00:00:02:00    0704 6880 8FFE
```

Command: `ccasdi PBSTimeFakeSCC.scc`

Output: 

```
SCC_disassembly V1.2
CHANNEL 3

00:00:01:00    {XDS Ms TM 03:21S _SA Dec 03 1999 Fri \Cb3}
00:00:02:00    {XDS Ms TZ -16D \Cfe} 
```

"Hour in UTC (UTC is London's time zone--subtract four hours to get Eastern Time, eight hours to get Pacific Time; note that date and Day of Week are also UTC)" so I take it this is 19:21 PT on Dec 02 1999 Thu (the station is in WA).

Unfortunately the Local Time Zone field appears to be wrong. It's saying -16 daylight instead of -8 standard.
